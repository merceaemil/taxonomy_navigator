Products compliant with the thresholds can also be granted Taxonomy compliant status.<br>To be making substantial contribution to the objective of climate change mitigation, steel making facilities must comply with two sets of criteria: <br>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;facility-specific (based on the major technological process utilised by the facility, for example blast furnace or direct reduction of iron facilities) and <br>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cross-cutting (related to feedstock used by the facility regardless of the main technological process utilised on it). <br>Since steel production facilities can operate for many years, new facilities should already be built with GHG emissions mitigation technologies in place or avoid GHG generation entirely by limiting the use of fossil fuels. The technical challenges are such that this is very important at the design stage – for example, if a plant is not designed to have Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) implemented, it will be very difficult to retrofit later.<br>To determine the carbon emission intensity thresholds for the technical screening criteria, the International Energy Agency Net-Zero Emissions (IEA NZE)  decarbonisation pathway adjusted in line with the Climate Aligned Finance Framework for Steel approach  was utilised. <br>The IEA NZE Benchmark used by the Sustainable STEEL Principles is a modified version of the “Net Zero by 2050” scenario published by the IEA in 2021, with the following modifications: <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yearly emissions and scrap utilisation data was interpolated using the decadal emissions and scrap utilisation data published by the IEA in the “Net Zero by 2050” report. <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scope 1 emissions were taken directly from the IEA’s “Net Zero by 2050” report, while Scope 2 emissions were estimated using the technology shares of total production included in the report paired with the corresponding emissions factors included in the Mission Possible Partnership model .<br>Currently, steelmakers calculate their CO2e emissions intensity according to their scope of production and in accordance with scopes 1, 2, and/or 3, as determined by the GHG Protocol. However, in the steel sector, there is a high degree of variability in the ownership structure and level of vertical integration of production facilities. This causes inconsistent emissions accounting, particularly for scope 3 and makes it difficult to compare steel companies equitably. <br>To ensure the emissions intensity values are comparable, the approach from the Sustainable STEEL Principles , where applicants quantify their emissions intensity within a Fixed System Boundary of activities , applies. <br>In the context of Taxonomy criteria, emissions boundary for calculating CO2e emissions intensity covers only scope 1 and 2 emissions. The scope of emissions to be considered for carbon intensity calculations for the different types of steel production facilities is specified in Figure 2.",
